## AJAX Chat Applicaiton

The program allows users to log into their chat accounts and begin talking to other people. I was initially planning on upgrading this project to include the creation of custom accounts with email verification but I will most likely try and create a new chat application uses some Javascript Frameworks.

## Implemenation

A MySQL database will be used in conjuction with PHP scripts and AJAX to allow for verification and validation of a user's information. After the user's information is properly checked they will be able to send messages to each other that will be stored in the database. After a user disconnects all chat logs will be deleted.
